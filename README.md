COVID-19 Data (Last Update January 2023)
For the visualization of the data on Tableau https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gabriel.franca/viz/COVIDDashboard_16735386176120/Dashboard1

This project shows different data analysis from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The main goal was to show data from the entire world and at the same time focusing on Brazil and the USA.
I added a comment before each query describing what it is going to show you.
In this project you will find numbers like the total cases, total deaths, death percentage, average of vaccinations applied every day and a lot more.
All this data was collected from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
